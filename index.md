## Welcome to Fit Gamer Studio

Today, we're talking about [how to build your home gym](https://github.com/haleytaylor1/Fit-Gamer/edit/gh-pages/index.md) as a gamer with not much more time on their hands for anything besides gaming.

We're very excited to embark on this journey with you, discussing new topics every week about what it means to be a gamer into fitness, and hopefully teaching you something along the way!
